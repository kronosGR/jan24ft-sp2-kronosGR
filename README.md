# Noroff

## Back-end Development Year 2

### Note

![endpoints](endpoints.png)

Because in the instructions were some inconsistencies, in some places it was saying /manager as the picture above and in other places it was saying /management, I chose the first one as the picture. I talk with Frederick Johannes Botha and he told me to keep it
as it is and it is ok and just to add a note here.

### Start Project

```
cd gateway
// start the gateway and the microservices
npm run startall

// or start one by one by going to gateway, products, management and customer folders
// and run
npm start

```
